   Test that FLaP does properly flatten SVG inclusions that use the
   'svg' package.

# Describe the LaTeX projects, as found on the disk
project:
  - path: main.tex
    content: |
      \documentclass{article}
      \usepackage{svg}
      \begin{document}
         \includesvg{graphics/svg/picture}
         \includesvg[svgpath=./graphics/svg]{picture}
      \end{document}
  - path: graphics/svg/picture.svg
    content: |
      This is a SVG image!

# Describe the LaTeX project, once flattened
expected:
  - path: merged.tex
    content: |
      \documentclass{article}
      \usepackage{svg}
      \begin{document}
         \includesvg{graphics_svg_picture}
         \includesvg[svgpath=./graphics/svg]{graphics_svg_picture}
      \end{document}
  - path: graphics_svg_picture.svg
    content: |
      This is a SVG image!

Flap is a simple utility that flattens LaTeX projects. It takes a
well-organised LaTeX project&mdash;one you so carefully crafted&mdash;and
merged it into a vulgar single LaTeX file in a 'flat' directory.

*Why?* Some publishers require one such flat structure when you submit
the sources of your manuscript, and I got tired to flatten the sources
by hand.

*Another one?* There already a couple of tools that merge latex projects
such as http://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexpand[latexpand], http://www.ctan.org/pkg/flatex[flatex]
or http://www.ctan.org/pkg/flatten[flatten]. As far as I know, they only merge
TeX files, without moving graphics around. I learned recently about
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/texdirflatten[texdirflatten], which seems to be
an alternative, but I haven't tried it.

== Installation
FLaP *requires* Python 3 (3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 are tested).  Python 3.2 is not compatible anymore. The easiest way to install FLaP is to use pip using `pip install flap`.

Alternatively, you may download the sources distribution and use `python
setup.py install`

== Usage Example
For the newest (development) version, use:
----
$> flap project/main.tex output/directory
----


Prior to v0.4.1 (included), we invoke FLaP using:
----
$> python -m flap project/main.tex output/directory
----

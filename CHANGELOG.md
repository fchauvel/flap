# Versions History

## FLaP v0.5.0 (Jan. 10, 2017)
This new version is a complete rewrite of the engine. FLaP now parses the LaTeX sources instead of matching regular expressions. Among other things, this permits a proper handling of verbatim environments. Any feedback is more than welcome.

* Python Support:
    * FLaP v0.5.0 is not compatible with Python 3.2 anymore (now deprecated).
    * Support for Python 3.5 and 3.6

* New features:
    * Invocation using `flap main.tex output_dir` instead of `python -m flap ...`
    * A more robust command line interface, based on [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/6/)
    * Support for verbatim environments (e.g., `\begin{verbatim}`)
    * Generation of a log file to track what FLaP did (especially useful when it fails)
    * Detection of index files
    * Detection of bibliography files in subdirectories
    * Detection of required class files (e.g., `\documentclass{my-arcticle}`)
    * Detection of required local packages (e.g., `\usepackage{my-style}`)

* Documentation
    * Acceptance tests framework
    * Compatibility with Python version

## FLaP v0.4.1 (Oct. 3, 2016)

This new release fixes minor bugs, especially use of additional white spaces in LaTeX commands. It also fixes:

 * Fix for running FLaP on a LaTeX file located in the working directory;
 * Fix regarding the extraction of subfiles directives;
 * Fix regarding whitspaces in multiline commands;
 * Fix extra space before the argument (including \input, \include, \includegraphics, \subfile)

Besides, it also includes additional tools to describe end-to-end test as YAML files, which can then be added without editing any code.

## FLaP v0.4.0 (Sep. 5, 2016)
This new version supports the use of the [subfiles package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfiles?lang=en) and also fixes various bugs as follow:

 * Support invoking FLaP while giving a specific name to the merged file, using `python -m flap my/root.tex output/new_root.tex`
 * Fix flattening `\bibliography`stored in a subdirectory
 * Fix bug on `\graphicpath` directives using double curly braces (e.g., `\graphicpath{{./img/}}`).
 * Fix bugs on `\input` directives:
 * `\input` directive that specify the `.tex` extension are properly handled;
 * Relative paths specified in `\input` are considered from the root directory of the latex project, as LaTeX does.
 * Fix for LaTeX commands broken down over multiple lines (see Issue #12)
 * Fix for images whose name conflict once merged (see Issue #14)
 * Add support for `subfile` directives (see Issue #13)

## FLaP v0.3.0 (Sep. 16, 2015)

This new release now supports both `\includeonly`and `\graphicspath`commands. It also includes a couple of bug fixes, especially regarding the verbose option, which gets broken in v0.2.4 (see issue #8)

## FLaP v0.2.4 (Sep. 2, 2015)

Bug fix for Issue #1 and other minor improvements, such as support for Python 3.3 and support for the `\endinput`command in Beamer presentations.

## FLaP v0.2.3 (Aug. 27, 2015)

Bug fix regarding the resolution of included images paths (https://github.com/fchauvel/flap/issues/3#issuecomment-136085551). In addition, releases are now also tested under Python 3.2.

## FLaP v0.2.2 (Aug. 25, 2015)

Fix bugs reported in Issue https://github.com/fchauvel/flap/issues/1#issuecomment-134835901 and adding support for 'overpic' environment (see #2).

## FLaP v0.2.0 (Aug. 23, 2015)

Fix for Issue #1. This new release supports `\include` and `\includesvg`directives as well as multi-line commands (where a LaTeX command is broken down using comments).

## FLaP v0.1.0 (Aug. 15, 2015)

First release! Three main things:
 * Only detect `\includegraphics` and `\input`directives
 * Not yet tested under a UNIX-like file system
